dagsub:
* Restart DAGs will not work reliably unless pbs_server is configured to
  keep jobs for some period of time after they end (e.g. qmgr -c "set
  server keep_completed = 300").  Without this setting, dagsub is not
  able to determine whether or not a job completed successfully unless
  it happens to check while the completed job is in the 'E' state
  (which is typically only a few seconds).
* When specify "RETRY" on one of the parents (i.e.job1), a child will
  sometimes be missing any other dependencies (i.e. job5 will only depend
  on job1, even if the job5 has other parents, e.g. job2-4). In other words,
  after job1 is complete, job2-4 + job5 can run concurrently, when job5
  supposed to wait for job2-4 finishing first.  The problem appears to
  be in dependency handling; if one of the afterok jobs is in the 'C' state,
  state, the child job will only add it to the dependency, and the rest of
  the parents job are left out.  Uncomment the RETRY in
  examples/dagsub/forecast/forecast.dag to see an example of this.
* Jobs sometimes fail to follow the "afterok" dependency.  This appears to be
  a bug in TORQUE; see
  http://www.supercluster.org/pipermail/torqueusers/2009-July/009282.html for
  details.
