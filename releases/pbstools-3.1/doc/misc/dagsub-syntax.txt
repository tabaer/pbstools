From http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.0/2_10DAGMan_Applications.html:

JOB jobname submit-file [DIR workdir] [DONE]
* jobname must be unique
* submit-file = script to submit
* workdir = optional working directory
* DONE = job has already completed (i.e. is a no-op)

DATA jobname script-to-submit [DIR workdir] [extensions] [DONE]
* jobname must be unique
* submit-file = script to submit
* workdir = optional working directory
* DONE = job has already completed (i.e. is a no-op)
* Proposed extensions (all optional):
  FORMAT type -- script is in "type" format (e.g. stork, rft, dmover)
  MOVER type -- use "mover" to do data movement (e.g. stork, rft, dmover,
                globus-url-copy, supermover)
  QUEUE name -- submit data job to queue "name", if available

SCRIPT (PRE|POST) jobname executable [arguments]

PARENT parentjob [parentjobs] CHILD childjob [childjobs]

RETRY jobname count [UNLESS-EXIT value]
* count = # times to retry jobname
* may be difficult to implement in TORQUE

VARS jobname macro="string" [macro2="string"]

PRIORITY jobname value
* "The node priority affects the order in which nodes that are ready at
   the same time will be submitted."

CATEGORY jobname categoryname
* "Node categories are used for job submission throttling."

MAXJOBS category maxjobs
* "If the number of submitted jobs for a given category reaches the limit,
   no further jobs in that category will be submitted until other jobs in the
   category terminate."
* "Note that a single invocation of condor_submit counts as one job, even if
   the submit file produces a multi-job cluster."

CONFIG cfgfile
* for setting macros/environment variables

DOT filename
* Generates a graph file compatible with the dot program from graphviz.org.

ABORT-DAG-ON jobname abortexitvalue [RETURN dagreturnvalue]
* abort entire DAG if one node fails with a specific status

-----
Fixed bug(s):
** multiple dependencies problem is now fixed.

*** Implementation Priority ***

Done:
* JOB
* DATA (modulo DIR)
* PARENT
* SCRIPT PRE and POST
* VARS
** PRIORITY
** DOT
** RETRY
** ABORT-DAG-ON
** Rescue DAGs (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.0/2_10DAGMan_Applications.html#SECTION003106000000000000000) (complete)
** parallelize for multiple dag files (fork)
** Command line option compatibility with condor_submit_dag (partial)

    verbose
    help
    log

Need:
** Command line option compatibility with condor_submit_dag (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v6.2/condor_submit_dag.html) (complete)
    maxjobs
    notification
** Return value for post script
    For use as an argument to POST scripts, the $RETURN variable evaluates to the return value of the Condor or Stork job. 
    A job that dies due to a signal is reported with a $RETURN value representing the negative signal number. 
    For example, SIGKILL (signal 9) is reported as -9. A job whose batch system submission fails is reported as -1001. 
    A job that is externally removed from the batch system queue (by something other than condor_ dagman) is reported as -1002.
** Consider how dagman handles fail/success node based on the return values of pre,post scripts and job.
